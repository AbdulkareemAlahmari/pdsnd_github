### Project Title
Bike Share Data Analysis

### Description

This project explores and analyzes bike-sharing data from three major citiesâ€”Chicago, New York City, and Washington, D.C. The aim is to derive insights into bike usage patterns, identify popular routes, and observe peak usage times. The project uses Python to process and analyze large datasets, calculating various descriptive statistics and enabling data-driven decision-making for optimizing bike share services. Additionally, the analysis is structured to provide an interactive terminal-based experience, where users can specify the city and type of statistics they want to view, making it a user-friendly and customizable tool for data exploration.
